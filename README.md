# ffwenns

In 2008 we have started to work on our graduation project with the title:

> Gestaltung einer Website für die Freiwillige Feuerwehr Wenns
> — Öffentlichkeitsarbeit einer Non-Profit-Organisation

As it turned out, the site got quite successful and rich of content. In 2015, I wanted to do a relaunch, but failed totally. Another team of graduates from the same school came up with a new site without the content of the past, but didn't succeed either. While at the same time the fire department decided to just publish their posts on Facebook.

This project aims to merge all the news from more of a decade and wants to ensure history, present and future. The work that has been done by many volunteers all over time. 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Everyday, all the time, always on duty for the people.

## Migrate

To migrate posts, run `yarn link` before you're able to call:

```
ffw
```

This command is responsible for migrations, including:

- [x] ~ 600 posts from wordpress back in the day
- [ ] all the posts on Facebook and Instagram

but will be also able to automate the import of upcoming news and export PDFs for backup locally.
